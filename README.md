# Billboard-Hot-100-Playlist-Creator

This is a simple project that uses Spotifyâ€™s API and Beautiful Soup to dynamically curate personalized Spotify playlists featuring the Billboard Top 100 songs from a specefic date based off the users choice.

# How it works

After a user enters their specefic date in the terminal, the program searches the internet for the Hot 100 website for that specefic date(every single date is posted online). Once the program finds the website, it uses Beautiful Soup to webscrape the songs. Using the Spotify API, I can then use those 100 songs to create a playlist that is added to my Spotify account.
